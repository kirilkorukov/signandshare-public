                Online petitions are a very effective way of gathering support for a cause you care about and drawing attention to that cause. Many of our petition hosts have gathered hundreds and even thousands of signatures on their petitions — petition targets have had to stand up and take notice! To be truly effective in creating change, however, you need to be actively involved in promoting your petition. You should send out emails to all your friends and colleagues, and you should promote your petition on discussion groups and other websites where users might be interested in your cause.</div>

                We give you everything you need to run a campaign. We make the process of starting a petition very easy – its just 5 steps and takes up to 10 minutes. After publishing, we keep helping you to make your petition successful by providing a detailed petition guide.</div>

                <div class="faq_answer">First of all, the biggest advantage of an online petition is that it reaches hundreds of millions of people, who use the internet every day. Plus, you get your own URL. You can`t do any of that with a paper petition. Can you even imagine going outside on the street and collecting signatures? It would take a whole day to collect just a hundred signatures, and that is an optimistic prediction. What is more, an online petition allows you to use viral marketing to popularize it. Your friends can always share your petition on the many social networking sites, such as Facebook and Twitter. This way it will have reached thousands of people in no time. And all that for free!</div>

Also, you can always decide to replace your name with “Don't display my name” by checking a specific box on the website.<br><br>
                At the close of the petition, all of the signature information is provided to the author, except for your  email address, street address and telephone number. They will only be used if we need to verify the validity of your signature. Your privacy is a number one priority. We, the team of Sign & Share believe in protecting personal privacy online.

This option will always be available for signers.

                Once the author of the petition and the petition target agree on a solution to the problem, the petition is regarded as successful. The number of signatures on your petition has little to do with how successful it is. We see both petitions with 10 and with 10 000 signatures win. However, more signatures mean more support which means the petition target will feel more compelled to react.</div>
